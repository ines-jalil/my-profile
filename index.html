                <h3> Soccer (football) </h3>
                <p>I am passionate about <strong> soccer </strong> (or more correctly called, football). To me, it is more than just a sport or a game. It has the power to transcend borders and bring people together regardless of their backgrounds, nationalities, origins, age, financial status, or social standing. Whether you're from a Brazilian favela or at the top of the tallest skyscraper in Dubai, football serves as a unifying agent, building an international community bound by shared emotions. When you step into a stadium, the cares and worries of everyday life fade away. All that matters are singing and shouting for your team in the stands, fighting on the pitch, and winning. Then, in victory, we celebrate together, in defeat, we cry together, and through all those beautiful moments, the support for the club only grows stronger.</p>

                <h3>Cars</h3>
                <p>One day, after years of rushing to my window whenever I heard her car, my neighbor took me for a ride. It was at that moment that I discovered the enchantment of the automotive world. It began with the roar of the engine, followed by the sensation of freedom, the rush of adrenaline... There are two ways to perceive a car: as a mere means of transportation from point A to point B, perhaps occasionally beautiful, or as the union of technology and innovation, intricately engineered to deliver incredible performance while providing a true driving experience. Throughout its history, the automotive industry has always managed to use every circumstance, even the most challenging ones, to reinvent itself, to become even better, and ultimately, to build its legacy. The more I delved into it, the more I fell in love with <strong> cars </strong>, and became part of a community founded on mutual exchange and support, but above all, united by a shared passion: cars.</p>

            <div id="food">
                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p> Another one of my passions is undoubtedly <strong> food </strong>. I may not be one to eat in large quantities, but I certainly do eat frequently. What I find enchanting about it is the ability to savor diverse flavors and the way it brings people together, so much that it becomes the common point of almost all your best memories. When you invite people to watch football, there is pizza; a trip to the cinema requires popcorn; when you invite someone home, it very often implies lunch, snacks, or dinner; and even casual hangouts with friends involve a detour to a restaurant. For me, the reason why lies in its simplicity and the joy it brings. Food has a way of creating a sense of unity and comfort, effortlessly putting everyone on the same page. Actually, when my closest friends notice that I am not in a good mood, they either bring me food or bring me to the food. But, beyond its role as a creative and sensory experience with immense social significance, food is also deeply rooted in history and cultural heritage. It serves as a cultural touchstone for entire nations or regions. The iconic "oui oui baguette" referring to Paris‚Ä¶ For all of these reasons, I firmly believe that by exploring new flavors, we travel, tasting the essence of new destinations along the way.
